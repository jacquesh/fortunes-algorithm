An implementation of Fortune's algorithm in C++. It is not production-ready and not bug-free, but hopefully easier to read and understand than some other implementations out there.

I wrote an overview of how it works [here](https://jacquesh.github.io/post/fortunes-algorithm/)

Requires [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) to compile.
